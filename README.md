## Refresh For Fever (Android)

This simple app just calls the refresh url of your [Fever Service](http://feedafever.com/) at regular intervals.
Sure, you also could set up a cronjob running on a server, but if you donâ€™t want to maintain this server, use an Android device with this app instead.

This app supports Android 4.4 and is still in its alpha phase.
